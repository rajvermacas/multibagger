## KEY DATA EXTRACTION PATTERNS

```
PATTERN: Excel Date Conversion
- Excel stores dates as numbers (days since 1900-01-01)
- Formula: python_date = datetime(1900, 1, 1) + timedelta(days=excel_number - 2)

PATTERN: Multi-Sheet Consolidation
- Data Sheet often contains summary from other sheets
- Prioritize Data Sheet for consolidated metrics
- Fall back to individual sheets for detailed data

PATTERN: Ratio Calculation Safety
- Always check for division by zero
- Handle missing data gracefully
- Use try-except blocks for robust calculation

PATTERN: Trend Analysis
- Minimum 3 data points for trend calculation
- Use both YoY and QoQ growth for momentum
- Weight recent quarters more heavily
```
