  Step 5: Save the Report

  After creating the markdown report, save it using this command:  
  - Save the markdown report to the reports directory  
  - Replace [CompanyName] with actual company name from JSON  
  - Example filename: Vintron_Info_Investment_Report.md  

  The final file should be saved at:
  /root/projects/Multibagger/resources/reports/<today date in YYYY-MM-DD format>/[CompanyName]_Investment_Report.md

  Critical Instructions:

  1. Use ONLY actual data from the JSON file - never make up numbers
  2. If data is missing or zero, explicitly state "Data not available" or "Unable to calculate"
  3. Include specific numerical values in all analysis - avoid vague statements
  4. Base the recommendation entirely on the calculated investment score and metrics
  5. Show your work - explain how you arrived at conclusions using the data
  6. Create tables for better readability of financial metrics
  7. Use appropriate emojis and formatting for professional presentation
  8. If the JSON shows poor data quality, mention this prominently in limitations
  9. SAVE the final markdown report to the specified path in the reports directory
  10. Confirm the file path where the report was saved in your final response

  Execute all steps sequentially, create the complete markdown report, save it to the specified location, and confirm the saved file path as your final output.
