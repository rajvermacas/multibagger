## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Zodiac Energy Ltd presents a mixed investment profile with strong revenue growth but concerning profitability and leverage metrics. The company has demonstrated exceptional revenue expansion with a 42% CAGR over the past 5 years, growing from ₹9.19 crores in 2016 to ₹407.78 crores in 2025. However, the investment case is weakened by low profit margins (4.9% net profit margin), high debt levels (D/E ratio of 3.78), and missing cash flow data that limits comprehensive analysis.

**Key Investment Highlights:**
- **Growth Champion:** Outstanding revenue CAGR of 52.41% over 10 years
- **Margin Concern:** Low net profit margin of 4.9% indicates competitive pressure
- **High Leverage:** Debt-to-Equity ratio of 3.78 poses financial risk
- **Valuation:** P/E ratio of 34.66 appears reasonable given growth trajectory
